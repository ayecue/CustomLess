# CustomLess

> Compatible with Pimcore 3.x.x

Basicly it's like the native pimcore integration. I just updated the less.php file to the newest version and I also updated the less.js file the newest.

Also this file uses a website property named "lessPluginPathToLessC" if you got lessc installed on your server.
